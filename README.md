The Superstore Sales Dashboard is an interactive business intelligence solution developed using Power BI to analyze and visualize sales, profit, discount, and customer behavior data from a sample Superstore dataset. The project involved importing raw data, performing data cleaning and transformation in Power Query by removing duplicates, handling null values, and converting data types, followed by creating a date table and establishing relationships for effective data modeling. Using DAX, various calculated columns and measures were created, such as Profit Margin, Sales per Order, Total Sales, Total Profit, and Average Discount, to enable deeper insights. The dashboard features multiple visuals including bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, maps, and KPI cards, along with slicers to filter by category, region, segment, and year. Key findings revealed top-performing products and regions, highlighted excessive discounts impacting profitability, and identified seasonal sales spikes during Q4. The report was published on the Power BI Service for real-time stakeholder access and supports strategic decision-making by simplifying reporting and identifying growth opportunities. Future enhancements include integrating live data using SQL or APIs, implementing predictive analytics for sales forecasting, and adding automated alerts and scheduled email reports to improve business monitoring.
